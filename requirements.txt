# Requirements for the Financial Calculator Application
# 
# This project primarily uses Python's built-in modules and doesn't require
# external dependencies for the main functionality.
#
# For testing, we use the built-in unittest module, so no additional
# packages are required.
#
# If you want to add additional testing tools in the future, consider:
# pytest>=7.0.0          # Alternative testing framework
# coverage>=6.0          # Code coverage measurement
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0      # Coverage plugin for pytest
